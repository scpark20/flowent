/home/scpark/hard/datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0002.wav|in being comparatively modern.
/home/scpark/hard/datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0003.wav|For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process

/home/scpark/hard/datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0011.wav|it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;
/home/scpark/hard/datasets/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0012.wav|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters
